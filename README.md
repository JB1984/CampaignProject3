# CampaignProject3

This is a basic Kickstarter like clone that uses the Ethereum network for its backend, this includes creation of projects and also donations. It is built off a Udemy tutorial series that is really great. https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/overview. 

The basic idea is that you have a main page that lists all current projects that everyone has created. You can donate to open projects that you like and you will become an "approver", as such you will have a say in how the project spends its money by approving or denying spending requests. The person who created the contract creates spending requests when they want to use some of the Ether in a contract for expenses. Approvers (people who donated to the campaign) either approve or deny said request and if the request gets over 50% approval it is able to be finalized by the manager.

I may continue to add features and improvements to this app as time goes on, also I may try and create a production build and host it on a website. My main goal with this project was to learn the basics of Ethereum Dapp creation and then apply it to my own project. 

This app is in development. If you want to give it a try just do the following:
  1. Clone this project
  2. In the project folder open a console and type in "npm run dev". Note you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
  3. Once npm has a local server running navigate to http://localhost:3000
  
  
You can view the app all you want but if you want to try out some features and create test campaigns you will need MetaMask and also in MetaMask you will need to create accounts on the Rinkby test network, as this is the one we are using for development.

Hope you enjoy messing around with the app and also if you have the time perhaps give Dapp development a shot, its a lot of fun.
